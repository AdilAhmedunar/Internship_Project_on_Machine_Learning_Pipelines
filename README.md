## Project Description
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p align="justify"> This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the acquisition status of startups based on various features such as funding rounds, total funding amount, industry category, and 
    geographic location. By leveraging machine learning pipelines, we preprocess the data, select relevant features, and train models to classify startups into different acquisition status categories. The project utilizes 
    Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and XGBoost for model development and evaluation. The goal is to provide insights into the factors influencing startup acquisition and build a predictive tool that can 
    assist stakeholders in making informed decisions.
