# Project Description {:#project-description}
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p align="justify"> This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the acquisition status of startups based on various features such as is_closedfunding rounds, total funding amount, industry 
    category, and geographic location. By leveraging machine learning pipelines, we preprocess the data, select relevant features, and train models to classify startups into different acquisition status categories. The 
    project utilizes Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib, and XGBoost for model development and evaluation. The goal is to provide insights into the factors influencing startup 
    acquisition and build a predictive tool that can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions.
